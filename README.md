### Chessboard
Jungle game has an interesting chessboard with differerent terrains including dens, traps and rivers.

The three kinds of special terrains are explained as:
+ Dens(兽穴): It is not allowed that a piece enters its own den.
+ Trap(陷阱): If a piece entering the opponents's trap, then its rank is reduced into 0 temporarily before exiting. The trapped piece could be captured by any pieces of the defensing side.
+ River(河流): They are located in the center of the chessboard, each comprising 6 squares in a 3×2 rectangle. Only rats could enter the river, and lions and tigers could jump across the river.

### Rules
1. Game Initialization: At the beginning, all 16 pieces are put into the chessboard as the initial state.
  
2. Game Progress: The player with blue color moves first. Two players take the turn alternatively until the game is finished. When a player takes turn, he/she can select one of his pieces and do one of the following moves:
+ Moving one square horizontally or vertically. For lion, tiger and rat, they also have special movements related to the river squares, which have been introduced previously.
+ Capturing an opposing piece. In all captures, the captured pieces is removed from the board and the square is occupied by the attacking piece. A piece can capture any enemy piece following the rules introduced in "Pieces".

3. Game Termination:
+ A player loses the game if one of the following conditions is met:
  - The den is entered by his/her opponent.
  - All of his/her pieces are captured.
  - The player runs out of valid moves in his/her turn.
  - In blitz mode, a player loses when his or her timer hits 0 first.
+ A game is considered a draw if none of winning conditions is met after 150 rounds. In other words, each player has played up to 150 moves each and there is still no winner after 300 moves in total.

Note for threefold repetition: If a player moves the same piece to the same board position for more than three times consecutively, any valid moves of that same piece to the repeated positon will be banned temporarily until the player moves any piece to a new valid position.
